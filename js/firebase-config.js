 *  1. FIREBASE_CONFIG: paste the web-app config from
 *     Firebase console → Project settings → General → Your apps → SDK setup (Config).
 *     These values are PUBLIC identifiers, not secrets. Security comes from
 *     firestore.rules (UID allowlist), not from hiding this object.
 *
 *  2. ALLOWED_UIDS: the Firebase Auth UIDs of the two people allowed to use the app.
 *     The SAME two UIDs must also be written into firestore.rules — the rules are
 *     what actually enforce access. This list only gives a friendly client-side error.
 *
 *  3. ICE_SERVERS / TURN: see README → "TURN server". Never put a TURN *shared secret*
 *     here. Only use short-lived credentials or a credentials URL from your provider.
